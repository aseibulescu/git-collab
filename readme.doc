A fast forward merge occurs when there is a linear path from the current branch to target branch.
The branches do not actually have to be merged, they just have to be integrated with one another so that they are up to date. 

A conflict will occur between two branches if the same line of code is changed. For example, if two different branches
are changing the title of the doc at the same time and they are committed, a conflict will occur and need to be resolved.
A conflict will not occur if a collaborator adds a p tag to the same file and writes something, and another collaborator 
adds a div tag for another purpose. These changes may be happening simultaneously, but to different areas of the file that will
not cause any conflicts.
